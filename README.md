## 🚀 Features

The dashboard includes the following NLP tools:

- 🗣️ **Text Generation**  
  Generate text using pre-trained language models.

- 📰 **Text Summarization**  
  Automatically summarize long texts into concise summaries.

- 😊 **Sentiment Analysis**  
  Analyze text sentiment (Positive / Negative).

- 🌍 **Translation (EN → AR)**  
  Translate English text into Arabic using neural machine translation.

- ❓ **Question Answering**
